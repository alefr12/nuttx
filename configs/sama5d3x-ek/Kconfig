	depends on SAMA5_BOOT_ISRAM
	---help---
		nor_main is a tiny program that runs in ISRAM.  nor_main will enable
		NOR flash then either (1) jump to the program in NOR flash or (2)
		wait for you to break in with GDB to debug the NOR program.

config SAMA5_NOR_START
	bool "Start NOR program"
	default n
	depends on SAMA5_NOR_MAIN
	---help---
		The default behavior of the NOR boot program is to initialize the
		NOR FLASH at CS0, then patiently wait for you to break into the
		program with GDB.  An alternative behvior is enabled with this
		option:  If SAMA5_NOR_START is defined, then it will not wait but
		will, instead, immediately start the program in NOR FLASH.
