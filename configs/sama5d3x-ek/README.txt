  This README file describes the port of NuttX to the SAMA5D3x-EK
  development boards. These boards feature the Atmel SAMA5D3
  microprocessors.  Four different SAMA5D3x-EK kits are available

    - SAMA5D31-EK with the ATSAMA5D1 (http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d31.aspx)
    - SAMA5D33-EK with the ATSAMA5D3 (http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d31.aspx)
    - SAMA5D34-EK with the ATSAMA5D4 (http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d31.aspx)
    - SAMA5D35-EK with the ATSAMA5D5 (http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d31.aspx)

  The each consist of an identical base board with different plug-in
  modules for each CPU.  An option 7 inch LCD is also available..

  The SAMA5D3FAE-EK bundle includes everything:  The base board, all four
  CPU modules, and the LCD.

Development Environment
=======================

  Several possibile development enviorments may be use:

  - Linux or OSX native
  - Cygwin unders Windows
  - MinGW + MSYS under Windows
  - Windows native (with GNUMake from GNUWin32).

  All testing has been performed using Cygwin under Windows.

  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems.

GNU Toolchain Options
=====================

  The NuttX make system will support the several different toolchain options.

  All testing has been conducted using the CodeSourcery GCC toolchain.  To use
  a different toolchain, you simply need to add change to one of the following
  configuration options to your .config (or defconfig) file:

    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y  : CodeSourcery under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYL=y  : CodeSourcery under Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_ATOLLIC=y        : Atollic toolchain for Windos
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_DEVKITARM=y      : devkitARM under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y      : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIL=y      : Generic GCC ARM EABI toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y      : Generic GCC ARM EABI toolchain for Windows

  The CodeSourcery GCC toolchain is selected with
  CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y and setting the PATH variable
  appropriately.

  If you are not using AtmelStudio GCC toolchain, then you may also have to
  modify the PATH in the setenv.h file if your make cannot find the tools.

  NOTE about Windows native toolchains
  ------------------------------------

  There are several limitations to using a Windows based toolchain in a
  Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath'
     utility but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check
     out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic
     links are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works
     around these problems for the Windows tools by copying directories
     instead of linking them.  But this can also cause some confusion for
     you:  For example, you may edit a file in a "linked" directory and find
     that your changes had no effect.  That is because you are building the
     copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic directory.  If you use a\
     Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  3. Dependencies are not made when using Windows versions of the GCC.  This is
     because the dependencies are generated using Windows pathes which do not
     work with the Cygwin make.

       MKDEP                = $(TOPDIR)/tools/mknulldeps.sh

  NOTE 1: Older CodeSourcery toolchains (2009q1) do not work with default
  optimization level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or
  -O2, but not with -Os.

  NOTE 2: The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

IDEs
====

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project (There is a simple RIDE project
  in the RIDE subdirectory).

  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include pathes:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/sam34,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/sam34/sam_vectors.S.  You may need to build NuttX
  one time from the Cygwin command line in order to obtain the pre-built
  startup object needed by RIDE.

NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M3 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M3 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  SourceForge download site (https://sourceforge.net/projects/nuttx/files/buildroot/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built binaries.

  See the file configs/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  details PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you are
  building a Cortex-M3 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

  NOTE:  Unfortunately, the 4.6.3 EABI toolchain is not compatible with the
  the NXFLAT tools.  See the top-level TODO file (under "Binary loaders") for
  more information about this problem. If you plan to use NXFLAT, please do not
  use the GCC 4.6.3 EABI toochain; instead use the GCC 4.3.3 OABI toolchain.
  See instructions below.

NuttX OABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  The older, OABI buildroot toolchain is also available.  To use the OABI
  toolchain, use the build instructtions above, but (1) modify the
  cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 configuration to use OABI (using 'make
  menuconfig'), or (2) use an exising OABI configuration such as
  cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3

NXFLAT Toolchain
================

  If you are *not* using the NuttX buildroot toolchain and you want to use
  the NXFLAT tools, then you will still have to build a portion of the buildroot
  tools -- just the NXFLAT tools.  The buildroot with the NXFLAT tools can
  be downloaded from the NuttX SourceForge download site
  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/nuttx/files/).

  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-defconfig-nxflat .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built NXFLAT binaries.

Loading Code into SRAM with J-Link
==================================

  Loading code with the Segger tools and GDB
  ------------------------------------------

    1) Change directories into the directory where you built NuttX.
    2) Start the GDB server and wait until it is ready to accept GDB
       connections.
    3) Then run GDB like this:

         $ arm-none-eabi-gdb
         (gdb) target remote localhost:2331
         (gdb) mon reset
         (gdb) load nuttx
         (gdb) ... start debugging ...

  Loading code using J-Link Commander
  ----------------------------------

    J-Link> r
    J-Link> loadbin <file> <address>
    J-Link> setpc <address of __start>
    J-Link> ... start debugging ...

Writing to FLASH using SAM-BA
=============================

  Assumed starting configuration:

    1. You have installed the J-Lnk CDC USB driver (Windows only, there is
        no need to install a driver on any regular Linux distribution),
    2. You have the USB connected to DBGU poort (J14)
    3. Terminal configuration:  115200 8N1

  Using SAM-BA to write to FLASH:

    1. Exit the terminal emulation program and remove the USB cable from
       the DBGU port (J14)
    2. Connect the USB cable to the device USB port (J20)
    3. JP9 must open (BMS == 1) to boot from on-chip Boot ROM.
    4. Press and maintain PB4 CS_BOOT button and power up the board.  PB4
       CS_BOOT button prevents booting from Nand or serial Flash by
       disabling Flash Chip Selects after having powered the board, you can
       release the PB4 BS_BOOT button.
    5. On Windows you may need to wait for a device driver to be installed.
    6. Start the SAM-BA application, selecting (1) the correct USB serial
       port, and (2) board = at91sama5d3x-ek.
    7. The SAM-BA menu should appear.
    8. Select the FLASH bank that you want to use and the address to write
       to and "Execute"
    9. When you are finished writing to FLASH, remove the USB cable from J20
       and re-connect the serial link on USB CDC / DBGU connector (J14) and
       re-open the terminal emulator program.
    10. If you loaded code in NOR flash (CS0), then you will need to close
        JP9 (BMS == 0) to force booting out of NOR flash (see NOTE).
    11. Power cycle the board.

  NOTES:  By closing JP9 (BMS == 0), you can force the board to boot
  directly to NOR FLASH.  Executing from other memories will require that
  you provide a special code header so that you code can be recognized as a
  boot-able image by the ROM bootloader.

Creating and Using NORBOOT
==========================

  In order to have more control of debugging code that runs out of NOR FLASH,
  I created the sama5d3x-ek/norboot configuration.  That configuration is
  described below under "Configurations."

  Here are some general instructions on how to build an use norboot:

  Building:
  1. Remove any old configurations (if applicable).

       cd <nuttx>
       make distclean

  2. Install and build the norboot configuration:

       cd tools
       ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<subdir>
       cd -
       . ./setenv.sh

     Before sourcing the setenv.sh file above, you should examine it and
     perform edits as necessary so that TOOLCHAIN_BIN is the correct path
     to the directory than holds your toolchain binaries.

  3. Rename the binaries.  Since you will need two versions of NuttX:  this
     norboot version that runs in internal SRAM and another under test in
     NOR FLASH, I rename the resulting binary files so that they can be
     distinguished:

       mv nuttx norboot
       mv nuttx.hex norboot.hex
       mv nuttx.bin norboot.bin

  4. Build your NOR configuration and write this into NOR FLASH.  Here, for
     example, is how you would create the NSH NOR configuration:

       cd <nuttx>
       make distclean                 # Remove the norboot configuration
       cd tools
       ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/nsh # Establish the NSH configuration
       cd -
       make                           # Build the NSH configuration

     Then use SAM-BA to write the nuttx.bin binary into NOR FLASH.  This
     will involve holding the CS_BOOT button and power cycling to start
     the ROM loader.  The SAM-BA serial connection will be on the device
     USB port, not the debug USB port.  Follow the SAM-BA instruction to
     write the nuttx.bin binary to NOR FLASH.

   5. Restart the system without holding CS_BOOT to get back to the normal
      debug setup.

   6. Then start the J-Link GDB server and GDB.  In GDB, I do the following:

       (gdb) mon reset                # Reset and halt the CPU
       (gdb) load norboot             # Load norboot into internal SRAM
       (gdb) mon go                   # Start norboot
       (gdb) mon halt                 # Break in
       (gdb) mon reg pc = 0x10000040  # Set the PC to NOR flash entry point
       (gdb) mon go                   # And jump into NOR flash

      The norboot program can also be configured to jump directly into
      NOR FLASH with out requiring the the final halt and go, but since I
      have been debugging the early boot sequence, the above sequence has
      been most convenient for me.

    STATUS:
      2013-7-30:  I have been unable to execute this configuration from NOR
        FLASH by closing the BMS jumper (J9).  As far as I can tell, this
        jumper does nothing on my board???  So I have been using the norboot
        configuration exclusively to start the program-under-test in NOR FLASH.

Buttons and LEDs
================

  Buttons
  -------
  There are five push button switches on the SAMA5D3X-EK base board:

    1. One Reset, board reset (BP1)
    2. One Wake up, push button to bring the processor out of low power mode
      (BP2)
    3. One User momentary Push Button
    4. One Disable CS Push Button

  Only the momentary push button is controllable by software (labeled
  "PB_USER1" on the board):

    - PE27.  Pressing the switch connect PE27 to grounded.  Therefore, PE27
      must be pulled high internally.  When the button is pressed the SAMA5
      will sense "0" is on PE27.

  LEDs
  ----
  There are two LEDs on the SAMA5D3 series-CM board that can be controlled
  by software.  A  blue LED is controlled via GPIO pins.  A red LED normally
  provides an indication that power is supplied to the board but can also
  be controlled via software.

    PE25.  This blue LED is pulled high and is illuminated by pulling PE25
    low.

    PE24.  The red LED is also pulled high but is driven by a transistor so
    that it is illuminated when power is applied even if PE24 is not
    configured as an output.  If PE24 is configured as an output, then the
    LCD is illuminated by a high output.

  These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
  defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
  include/board.h and src/sam_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
  events as follows:

    SYMBOL                Meaning                     LED state
                                                    Blue     Red
    -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------

    LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt              No change
    LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler          No change
    LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed          No change
    LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     OFF      Blinking
    LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode         Not used

  Thus if the blue LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and
  is, apparently, running normmally.  If the red is flashing at
  approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system
  has halted.

Serial Consoles
===============

  USART1
  ------
  By default USART1 is used as the NuttX serial console in all
  configurations (unless otherwise noted).  USART1 is buffered with an
  RS-232 Transceiver (Analog Devices ADM3312EARU) and connected to the DB-9
  male socket (J8).

    PB26 CTS1       GPIO_USART1_CTS

    NOTE: Debug TX and RX pins also go the the ADM3312EARU, but I am
    uncertain of the functionality.

  Hardware UART via CDC
  ---------------------
  "J-Link-OB-ATSAM3U4C comes with an additional hardware UART that is
   accessible from a host via CDC which allows terminal communication with
   the target device. This feature is enabled only if a certain port (CDC
   disabled, PA25, pin 24 on J-Link-OB-ATSAM3U4C) is NOT connected to ground
   (open).

    - Jumper JP16 not fitted: CDC is enabled
    - Jumper JP16 fitted : CDC is disabled"

    CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=0x0002000 (128Kb)

  CONFIG_RAM_START - The physical start address of installed DRAM

    CONFIG_RAM_START=0x20000000

  CONFIG_RAM_VSTART - The virutal start address of installed DRAM

    CONFIG_RAM_VSTART=0x20000000

  CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The SAM3UF103Z supports interrupt prioritization

Configurations
==============

  Information Common to All Configurations
  ----------------------------------------
  Each SAM3U-EK configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<subdir>
    cd -
    . ./setenv.sh

  Before sourcing the setenv.sh file above, you should examine it and perform
  edits as necessary so that TOOLCHAIN_BIN is the correct path to the directory
  than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       and misc/tools/

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on UART0 (J3).

  3. Unless otherwise stated, the configurations are setup for
     Linux (or any other POSIX environment like Cygwin under Windows):

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y   : Linux or other POSIX environment

  4. All of these configurations use the Code Sourcery for Windows toolchain
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).  That
     toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using 'make menuconfig'.
     Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOS=y                : Microsoft Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Using Cygwin or other POSIX environment

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU EABI toolchain for windows

     That same configuration will work with Atmel GCC toolchain.  The only
     change required to use the Atmel GCC toolchain is to change the PATH
     variable so that those tools are selected instead of the CodeSourcery
     tools.  Try 'which arm-none-eabi-gcc' to make sure that you are
     selecting the right tool.

     The setenv.sh file is available for you to use to set the PATH
     variable.  The path in the that file may not, however, be correct
     for your installation.

     See also the "NOTE about Windows native toolchains" in the section call
     "GNU Toolchain Options" above.

  Configuration sub-directories
  -----------------------------

  hello:
    This configuration directory, performs the (almost) simplest of all
    possible examples:  examples/hello.  This just comes up, says hello
    on the serial console and terminates.  This configuration is of
    value during bring-up because it is small and can run entirely out
    of internal SRAM.

    NOTES:
    1. This configuration uses the default USART1 serial console.  That
       is easily changed by reconfiguring to (1) enable a different
       serial peripheral, and (2) selecting that serial peripheral as
       the console device.

    2. By default, this configuration is set up to build on Windows
       under either a Cygwin or MSYS environment using a recent, Windows-
       native, generic ARM EABI GCC toolchain (such as the CodeSourcery
       toolchain).  Both the build environment and the toolchain
       selection can easily be changed by reconfiguring:

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Windows operating system
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : POSIX environment under windows
       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y : CodeSourcery for Windows

    3. This configuration executes out of internal SRAM and can only
       be loaded via JTAG.

       CONFIG_SAMA5_BOOT_ISRAM=y               : Boot into internal SRAM
       CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMISRAM=y              : Run from internal SRAM

    STATUS:
      2013-7-19:  This configuration (as do the others) run at 396MHz.
        The SAMA5D3 can run at 536MHz.  I still need to figure out the
        PLL settings to get that speed.

      2013-7-28:  This configuration was verified functional.

      2013-7-31:  Delay loop calibrated.

  norboot:
    This is a little program to help debug of code in NOR flash.  It
    does the following:

    - It enables and configures NOR FLASH, then
    - Waits for you to break in with GDB.

    At that point, you can set the PC and begin executing from NOR FLASH
    under debug control.

    NOTES:
    1. This program derives from the hello configuration.  All of the
       notes there apply to this configuration as well.

    STATUS:
      2013-7-19:  This configuration (as do the others) run at 396MHz.
        The SAMA5D3 can run at 536MHz.  I still need to figure out the
        PLL settings to get that speed.

      2013-7-31:  Delay loop calibrated.

  nsh:
    This configuration directory provide the NuttShell (NSH).

    NOTES:
    1. This configuration uses the default USART1 serial console.  That
       is easily changed by reconfiguring to (1) enable a different
       serial peripheral, and (2) selecting that serial peripheral as
       the console device.

    2. By default, this configuration is set up to build on Windows
       under either a Cygwin or MSYS environment using a recent, Windows-
       native, generic ARM EABI GCC toolchain (such as the CodeSourcery
       toolchain).  Both the build environment and the toolchain
       selection can easily be changed by reconfiguring:

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Windows operating system
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : POSIX environment under windows
       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y : CodeSourcery for Windows

    3. This configuration executes out of CS0 NOR flash and can only
       be loaded via SAM-BA.  These are the relevant configuration options
       the define the NOR FLASH configuration:

       CONFIG_SAMA5_BOOT_CS0FLASH=y            : Boot from FLASH on CS0
       CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH=y              : Run in place on FLASH (vs copying to RAM)

       CONFIG_SAMA5_EBICS0=y                   : Enable CS0 external memory
       CONFIG_SAMA5_EBICS0_SIZE=134217728      : Memory size is 128KB
       CONFIG_SAMA5_EBICS0_NOR=y               : Memory type is NOR FLASH

       CONFIG_FLASH_START=0x10000000           : Physical FLASH start address
       CONFIG_FLASH_VSTART=0x10000000          : Virtual FLASH start address
       CONFIG_FLASH_SIZE=134217728             : FLASH size (again)

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x00300400             : Data stored after page table
       CONFIG_RAM_VSTART=0x00300400
       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=114688                  : Available size of 128KB - 16KB for page table

       NOTE:  In order to boot in this configuration, you need to close the
       BMS jumper.

    4. This configuration has support for NSH built-in applications enabled.
       However, no built-in applications are selected in the base configuration.

    STATUS:
      2013-7-19:  This configuration (as do the others) run at 396MHz.
        The SAMA5D3 can run at 536MHz.  I still need to figure out the
        PLL settings to get that speed.

      2013-7-31:  I have been unable to execute this configuration from NOR
        FLASH by closing the BMS jumper (J9).  As far as I can tell, this
        jumper does nothing on my board???  I have been using the norboot
        configuration to start the program in NOR FLASH (see just above).
        See "Creating and Using NORBOOT" above.

      2013-7-31:  This NSH configuration appears to be fully functional.

      2013-7-31:  Using delay loop calibration from the hello configuration.
        That configuration runs out of internal SRAM and, as a result, this
        configuration needs to be recalibrated.

  ostest:
    This configuration directory, performs a simple OS test using
    examples/ostest.

    NOTES:
    1. This configuration uses the default USART1 serial console.  That
       is easily changed by reconfiguring to (1) enable a different
       serial peripheral, and (2) selecting that serial peripheral as
       the console device.

    2. By default, this configuration is set up to build on Windows
       under either a Cygwin or MSYS environment using a recent, Windows-
       native, generic ARM EABI GCC toolchain (such as the CodeSourcery
       toolchain).  Both the build environment and the toolchain
       selection can easily be changed by reconfiguring:

       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y : CodeSourcery for Windows

    3. This configuration executes out of CS0 NOR flash and can only
       be loaded via SAM-BA.  These are the relevant configuration options
       the define the NOR FLASH configuration:

       CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH=y              : Run in place on FLASH (vs copying to RAM)

       CONFIG_SAMA5_EBICS0=y                   : Enable CS0 external memory
       CONFIG_SAMA5_EBICS0_SIZE=134217728      : Memory size is 128KB
       CONFIG_SAMA5_EBICS0_NOR=y               : Memory type is NOR FLASH

       CONFIG_FLASH_START=0x10000000           : Physical FLASH start address
       CONFIG_FLASH_VSTART=0x10000000          : Virtual FLASH start address
       CONFIG_FLASH_SIZE=134217728             : FLASH size (again)

        The SAMA5D3 can run at 536MHz.  I still need to figure out the
        PLL settings to get that speed.

      2013-7-30:  I have been unable to execute this configuration from NOR
        FLASH by closing the BMS jumper (J9).  As far as I can tell, this
        jumper does nothing on my board???  I have been using the norboot
        configuration to start the program in NOR FLASH (see just above).
        See "Creating and Using NORBOOT" above.

       2013-7-31:  The OS test configuration is basically functional, but
         takes a very long time in the round-robin scheduler test computing
         prime numbers.  This test is supposed to be slow -- like several
         seconds -- but not many minutes.  No idea why yet.  The best guess
         would be an excessive number of context switches.

      2013-7-31:  Using delay loop calibration from the hello configuration.
        That configuration runs out of internal SRAM and, as a result, this
        configuration needs to be recalibrated.
